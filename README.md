### Todo

I plan to add support for Wear OS smart watches soon. To do so I need to:

* [ ] Move tea list creation out of MainActivityVM.
* [ ] Move utils and model packages to separate module.
* [ ] Don't use parcelable in model, use some form of object ID instead.
* [ ] Refactor settings initialization.
